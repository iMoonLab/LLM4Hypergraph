key: 1978, value: Hyper Firm Pyramid: Each hyperedges contains only three nodes, so the visual shape of each hyperedge is like a triangle. Because the hyperedges share two nodes between them in pairs: hyperedge (n0,n4,n7) is connected to hyperedge(n0,n1,n7) by nodes (n0,n7), hyperedge (n0,n1,n2) is connected to hyperedge(n0,n1,n7) by nodes (n0,n1), hyperedge (n0,n1,n2) is connected to hyperedge(n1,n2,n6) by nodes (n1,n2), hyperedge (n1,n5,n7) is connected to hyperedge(n0,n1,n7) by nodes (n1,n7), hyperedge (n1,n5,n7) is connected to hyperedge(n1,n5,n9) by nodes (n1,n5), hyperedge (n2,n6,n8) is connected to hyperedge(n1,n2,n6) by nodes (n2,n6), hyperedge (n1,n6,n9) is connected to hyperedge(n1,n2,n6) by nodes (n1,n6), hyperedge (n1,n6,n9) is connected to hyperedge(n1,n5,n9) by nodes (n1,n9), hyperedge (n3,n5,n9) is connected to hyperedge(n1,n5,n9) by nodes (n9,n5), the triangles represented by the hyperedges are arranged edge to edge. In summary, the visualized shape of the hypergraph is like a more firm pyramid with multiple triangles stacked and no gaps.
